# My-Coding-Journey-in-the-Quant-World
A collection of coding projects through my aspirational journey of becoming a quantitative trader/researcher

This GitHub repository will be used for me to track and showcase my journey on learning how to become a Quantitative trader/researcher. I have extensive experience coding in R through University projects, however most of the code that I will be putting up here will be in Python. I am currently trying to learn how to become a competent Quantitative trader/researcher, through online courses, Youtube videos and books. Since I still consider myself a novice coder, the mojoirty of my work will be modelled off others code with alterations by me to suit my needs better. I will clearly organise folders containing differnet projects and "strategeis" that I have developed, with short descriptions on thought process, improvements and challenges that I faced. For any other aspiring Quants, I hope that my work can be helpful, even though it is still quite simple and basic, I hope that it brings more insight into where and how to start. For more experienced coders and Quants, if you have any advice, recommendations or ways to optimize my work, please comment or message me. Any help will be greatly appriciated.
